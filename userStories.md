# Developer
Our goals as developers are to make a fun game with no bugs that is easy for the user to play and entertaining. We will do this by using javascript to create the moles and holes using a Canvas element.

# User
My goal as a user is to have an easy-to-navigate page with clear instructions on how to play the whack-a-mole game. I want a visually appealing page with feedback, such as my score, to know how I am doing.
